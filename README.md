### About This Project

A new gig (details later if allowed) has expressed a preference to move from
RDBMS to Mongo as a data store.  I had the same idea myself.  I have been
testing MONGO with the full Javascript stacks, Angular2, METEOR-React etc.

It dawned on me to give a REST architecture are run with Python and/or PHP
in the back end.  It may save some complexity.  It may not.

This is me having a looksee at pyMong.
