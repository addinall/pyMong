# Synopsis: A new gig (details later if allowed) has expressed a preference to move from
# RDBMS to Mongo as a data store.  I had the same idea myself.  I have been
# testing MONGO with the full Javascript stacks, Angular2, METEOR-React etc.
#
# It dawned on me to give a REST architecture are run with Python and/or PHP
# in the back end.  It may save some complexity.  It may not.
#
#This is me having a looksee at pyMong.
#For this cut, I am going to use Gulp, Bower and Browserify.
#
# OOD/OOP API in Python tied to a MONGO Document store.  Interesting.
